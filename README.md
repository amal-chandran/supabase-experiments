# supabase-experiments

This repository is to keep track of all the Supabase experiments.

## Branches

### `experiment/better-auth`

Experimenting with Better Auth as an alternative authentication solution to Supabase Auth. This branch includes a full-stack application built with React, TanStack Router, Hono, and Better Auth, featuring a comparison between Better Auth and Supabase Auth capabilities.

### `experiment/functions-code-share`

Exploring code sharing strategies between Node.js and Deno environments for Supabase Edge Functions. This branch demonstrates a monorepo structure that allows sharing code packages (like math and console utilities) across different runtime environments.

### `experiment/sdk-intellisense`

Setting up TypeScript type generation for Supabase SDK to enable better intellisense and type safety. This branch demonstrates how to generate database types from a local Supabase instance and integrate them with the Supabase client for full type inference, autocompletion, and type-safe queries.
